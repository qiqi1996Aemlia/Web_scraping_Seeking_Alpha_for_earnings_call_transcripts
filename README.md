# Web_scraping_Seeking_Alpha_for_earnings_call_transcripts

Objective:
Seeking Alpha hosts a vast collection of earnings call transcripts. However, the website is designed in a way that makes scraping slow and prone to subtle pitfalls, especially for those unfamiliar with its structure. This note documents my scraping strategy for extracting transcripts between January 2010 and July 2025.

ðŸ“Œ Scraping Workflow
1.Select a target ticker youâ€™re interested in.
2.Locate all transcript articles for the ticker
Run fetch_records_by_ticker.py to access:

https://seekingalpha.com/author/sa-transcripts/analysis?ticker={ticker}

This fetches all articles for that ticker and saves their metadata (ticker, publication date, title, and article link) as a {ticker}.json file.

3.Download the transcript content
Run download_transcripts.py to read the {ticker}.json file and download each transcript from the provided links.
Alternatively, you can merge both scripts and extract transcripts directly from the article pages.

# Why This Ticker-Based Strategy?
1.Avoiding article limit trap
Scraping directly from the global transcript archive:

https://seekingalpha.com/author/sa-transcripts/analysis

using infinite scroll (simulating human scrolling) reveals only ~36,000 articles â€” barely covering one year of data. Beyond that, older transcripts become inaccessible.

2.Avoiding invalid ticker trap
Even if a ticker doesnâ€™t exist, the website still loads the same archive page (not filtered by ticker). If not handled properly, this leads you back into the general archive view, breaking the ticker-specific pipeline.
